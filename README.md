# AnimationWithOpenGLBlender
This mini-project uses Blender to build 3d models and OpenGL used to run the simulation.

Blender used to draw the 3D models.

The rotors of the helicopter are saved to:

       bigrotors.py
       
       smallrotors.py
       
They both contain the lines, vertices, edges and faces used to draw the helicopter.

The helicopter rendered in:

       helicopterRenderer.py

The building rendered in :

       building_renderer.py

The mainv1.py houses all the components.

Enjoy!
